# RestaurantSpringBootH2MuServerApp
A Spring Boot project, use Mu-Server, H2 and JPA to implement Restful APIs for restaurant reservation management.

This project is based on Springboot, it configs H2 as testing DB (due to define DB stuff in JPA, so can work with other DB)

Mu Server is used to implement Restful APIs for restaurant reservation management. Due to this is just an assignment, many business logic need to add in future.
Combine Mu Server and Spring Boot together is my first time try, so far this repo still work not smoothly, need more time to polish.
